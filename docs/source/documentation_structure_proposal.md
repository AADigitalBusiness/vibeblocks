# TaskChain Documentation Structure Proposal

## Purpose

Define a clear, role-based documentation structure that is easy to navigate for:

- New users (onboarding through tutorials and examples)
- Advanced users (quick reference and glossary)
- Contributors and maintainers (bugs, pull requests, contribution workflow)

This proposal describes structure only. It does not rewrite existing content.

## Recommended Top-Level Navigation

1. Home
2. Start Here
3. Onboarding (New Users)
4. How-to Guides
5. Core Concepts
6. Quick Reference
7. API Reference
8. Glossary
9. Development and Contribution
10. Changelog and Migration Notes
