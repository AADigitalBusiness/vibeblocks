# How to Use Task, Process, and Workflow

## Intent

Use `Task` for atomic units, `Process` for ordered groups, and `Workflow` for orchestration strategy.

## Quick Mapping

- `Task`: one function with optional retry/undo
- `Process`: ordered composition of executable steps
- `Workflow`: top-level execution plan and failure strategy

## Reference

See [Core Concepts](../core_concepts.md) and [API Reference](../api_reference.rst).
